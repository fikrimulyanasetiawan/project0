I made a simple portfolio for myself. 
In the home page, i only added a headline and a "see more.." button that leads to portfolio.html

In the portfolio page, i made a simple gallery, and added some hover effects to the images

In about page, i only put my bio about me, and an image to make it cooler.

In the last page, which is contact.html. I put a form where people can contact me.
